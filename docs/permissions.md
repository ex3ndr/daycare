# Permissions

This document summarizes the permission helper functions extracted from the engine runtime.

  end

## Helper roles

- `permissionBuildDefault`: create the initial agent permissions from workspace + config paths.
- `permissionBuildCron`: build cron-specific permissions that inherit defaults.
- `permissionEnsureDefaultFile`: merge default read/write directories into an agent.
- `permissionMergeDefault`: combine existing agent permissions with defaults.
- `permissionApply`: apply an approved permission decision to an agent.
- `permissionFormatTag`: format the `@web`/`@read`/`@write` tag used in logs.
- `permissionDescribeDecision`: human-readable label for permission decisions.

## Foreground permission requests

Foreground agents request permissions directly from users via `request_permission`. The tool returns
immediately, and the permission decision is delivered later to resume the agent.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Foreground as Foreground Agent
  participant Connector
  participant User
  Foreground->>Connector: request_permission(permission, reason)
  Connector->>User: permission approval UI
  User->>Connector: approve/deny
  Connector->>Foreground: onPermission(decision)
  Foreground->>Foreground: permissionApply + resume message
```

Tool payload shape:

```json
{
  "permission": "@web",
  "reason": "Need to verify the latest docs."
}
```

## Background agent permission requests

Background agents cannot request permissions directly from users. They use
`request_permission_via_parent` to proxy requests through the most recent
foreground agent.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Background as Background Agent
  participant Engine
  participant User as User

  Background->>Engine: request_permission_via_parent (agentId)
  Engine->>User: permission request UI (most recent foreground target)
  User->>Engine: approve/deny
  Engine->>Background: route decision (agentId)
  Background->>Background: permissionApply
```

Tool availability by agent type:

| Tool | Foreground | Background |
|------|------------|------------|
| `request_permission` | ✓ | ✗ |
| `request_permission_via_parent` | ✗ | ✓ |

## Path security utilities

The permissions system includes security hardening against path-based attacks:

### pathSanitize

Validates paths for dangerous characters and patterns. Rejects:

- **Null bytes** (`\x00`): Can truncate strings in C libraries
- **Control characters**: ASCII 0-31 (except tab/newline)
- **Excessive length**: Paths over 4096 characters

```typescript
import { pathSanitize } from "./pathSanitize.js";

pathSanitize("/valid/path");          // OK
pathSanitize("/path\x00/malicious");  // throws "Path contains null byte."
```

### pathResolveSecure

Securely resolves a path with symlink following and containment verification. Prevents symlink escape attacks by:

1. Resolving all symlinks via `fs.realpath()`
2. Checking containment against real paths

```typescript
import { pathResolveSecure } from "./pathResolveSecure.js";

const allowedDirs = ["/workspace"];
const { realPath, allowedBase } = await pathResolveSecure(allowedDirs, "/workspace/file.txt");
```

### openSecure

Opens a file handle with symlink protection to prevent TOCTOU (time-of-check to time-of-use) attacks:

```typescript
import { openSecure } from "./pathResolveSecure.js";

const handle = await openSecure("/workspace/file.txt", "r");
// File is guaranteed to be a regular file, not a symlink
```

## Security model

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph Input
    UserPath[User Path]
  end

  subgraph Validation
    Sanitize[pathSanitize]
    ResolveSecure[pathResolveSecure]
    OpenSecure[openSecure]
  end

  subgraph Attack Prevention
    NullByte[Null byte injection]
    Symlink[Symlink escape]
    TOCTOU[TOCTOU race]
  end

  UserPath --> Sanitize
  Sanitize -->|validates| NullByte
  Sanitize --> ResolveSecure
  ResolveSecure -->|prevents| Symlink
  ResolveSecure --> OpenSecure
  OpenSecure -->|prevents| TOCTOU
```

### Threats mitigated

| Threat | Mitigation | Location |
|--------|------------|----------|
| Symlink escape | `fs.realpath()` before containment check | `pathResolveSecure` |
| TOCTOU race | Atomic open with `lstat` + file handle | `openSecure`, handlers |
| Null byte injection | Path validation | `pathSanitize` |
| Control character injection | Path validation | `pathSanitize` |
| Path length DoS | 4096 char limit | `pathSanitize` |
| Empty workingDir bypass | Nullish coalescing | `permissionMergeDefault` |
