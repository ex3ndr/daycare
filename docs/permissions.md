# Permissions

This document summarizes the permission helper functions extracted from the engine runtime.

## Helper roles

- `permissionBuildDefault`: create the initial agent permissions from workspace + config paths.
- `permissionBuildCron`: build cron-specific permissions that inherit defaults.
- `permissionEnsureDefaultFile`: merge default read/write directories into an agent.
- `permissionMergeDefault`: combine existing agent permissions with defaults.
- `permissionApply`: apply an approved permission decision to an agent.
- `permissionAccessAllows`: verify an agent already holds a permission before sharing it.
- `permissionTagsValidate`: validate that all permission tags are already held by the caller.
- `permissionFormatTag`: format the `@web`/`@read`/`@write` tag used in logs.
- `permissionDescribeDecision`: human-readable label for permission decisions.

## Permission requests

Foreground agents request permissions directly from users via `request_permission`. Background
agents call the same tool; the engine routes the request through the most recent foreground agent
and includes the requesting agent id so the decision returns to the right agent. The tool returns
immediately, and the permission decision is delivered later to resume the agent.

```mermaid

  participant Foreground as Foreground Agent
  participant Connector
  participant User
  Foreground->>Connector: request_permission(permission, reason)
  Connector->>User: permission approval UI
  User->>Connector: approve/deny
  Connector->>Foreground: onPermission(decision)
  Foreground->>Foreground: permissionApply + resume message
```

Tool payload shape:

```json
{
  "permission": "@web",
  "reason": "Need to verify the latest docs."
}
```

Tool availability by agent type:

| Tool | Foreground | Background |
|------|------------|------------|
| `request_permission` | ✓ | ✓ |
## Direct grants

Agents can share permissions with other agents using the `grant_permission` tool.
The grant is only allowed when the source agent already has the permission, and
every grant must include a justification.

```mermaid

  Source[Source agent] --> GrantTool[grant_permission]
  GrantTool --> Check[permissionAccessAllows]
  Check -->|allowed| Apply[permissionApply]
  Check -->|denied| Block[Reject grant]
```

## Scheduled tasks (cron/heartbeat)

Cron and heartbeat tasks do not carry permission tags. Task prompts and gates
run with the target agent's existing permissions only. Any `permissions` or
`gate.permissions` entries in task files are ignored.

```

## Path security utilities

The permissions system includes security hardening against path-based attacks:

### pathSanitize

Validates paths for dangerous characters and patterns. Rejects:

- **Null bytes** (`\x00`): Can truncate strings in C libraries
- **Control characters**: ASCII 0-31 (except tab/newline)
- **Excessive length**: Paths over 4096 characters

```typescript
import { pathSanitize } from "./pathSanitize.js";

pathSanitize("/valid/path");          // OK
pathSanitize("/path\x00/malicious");  // throws "Path contains null byte."
```

### pathResolveSecure

Securely resolves a path with symlink following and containment verification. Prevents symlink escape attacks by:

1. Resolving all symlinks via `fs.realpath()`
2. Checking containment against real paths

```typescript
import { pathResolveSecure } from "./pathResolveSecure.js";

const allowedDirs = ["/workspace"];
const { realPath, allowedBase } = await pathResolveSecure(allowedDirs, "/workspace/file.txt");
```

### openSecure

Opens a file handle with symlink protection to prevent TOCTOU (time-of-check to time-of-use) attacks:

```typescript
import { openSecure } from "./pathResolveSecure.js";

const handle = await openSecure("/workspace/file.txt", "r");
// File is guaranteed to be a regular file, not a symlink
```

## Security model

```mermaid

  subgraph Input
    UserPath[User Path]
  end

  subgraph Validation
    Sanitize[pathSanitize]
    ResolveSecure[pathResolveSecure]
    OpenSecure[openSecure]
  end

  subgraph Attack Prevention
    NullByte[Null byte injection]
    Symlink[Symlink escape]
    TOCTOU[TOCTOU race]
  end

  UserPath --> Sanitize
  Sanitize -->|validates| NullByte
  Sanitize --> ResolveSecure
  ResolveSecure -->|prevents| Symlink
  ResolveSecure --> OpenSecure
  OpenSecure -->|prevents| TOCTOU
```

### Threats mitigated

| Threat | Mitigation | Location |
|--------|------------|----------|
| Symlink escape | `fs.realpath()` before containment check | `pathResolveSecure` |
| TOCTOU race | Atomic open with `lstat` + file handle | `openSecure`, handlers |
| Null byte injection | Path validation | `pathSanitize` |
| Control character injection | Path validation | `pathSanitize` |
| Path length DoS | 4096 char limit | `pathSanitize` |
| Empty workingDir bypass | Nullish coalescing | `permissionMergeDefault` |
| Scheduled task permission escalation | Task permission tags ignored at load/run | `cronStore`, `heartbeatStore`, schedulers |
