# Config reload locking

Engine config reload now applies online through `Engine.reload()` using `InvalidateSync`.
Reload requests coalesce, then the latest config is applied inside a runtime write lock.

Read-locked runtime paths now include:
- connector message/command/permission handlers
- agent inbox item processing
- inference router completions
- cron scheduler task execution/tick
- heartbeat scheduler runs

This currently favors strict quiescence over reload latency: a config write lock
waits for in-flight inference calls to finish before applying changes.

Plugin/provider reload behavior during apply:
- providers: deep-equal settings are no-op; changed settings unload/load; unload always removes registry entries bound to the provider id
- plugins: deep-equal settings are no-op; changed settings unload/load; unload calls plugin `unload` first, then unregisters all registrar-owned modules
