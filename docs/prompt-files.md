# Prompt files

Daycare injects editable Markdown files into the system prompt. Agents read them every turn and can update them to persist knowledge across sessions.

## Files

| File | Path | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| SOUL.md | `~/.daycare/SOUL.md` | Agent personality and behavioral refinements |
| USER.md | `~/.daycare/USER.md` | Stable user facts, preferences, and context |
| ACTORS.md | `~/.daycare/ACTORS.md` | Known agents, roles, and signal subscriptions |
| TOOLS.md | `~/.daycare/TOOLS.md` | Learned tool knowledge — tips, pitfalls, patterns |

All four are automatically created from bundled templates on first run if missing.

## Injection

- Foreground agents see all four files in their system prompt.
- Background agents do not receive SOUL, USER, ACTORS, or TOOLS.
- Paths are shown in the write permissions allowlist so agents can edit them.
- Content is injected via triple-brace Handlebars (`{{{actors}}}`) to avoid HTML escaping.

## Source templates

Bundled defaults live in `sources/prompts/`:
- `SOUL.md` — personality scaffold
- `USER.md` — blank user profile fields
- `ACTORS.md` — empty agent/subscription tables
- `TOOLS.md` — empty tool knowledge tables
