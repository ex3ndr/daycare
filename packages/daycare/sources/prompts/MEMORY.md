# MEMORY.md

Durable working memory for the assistant.

Use this file for ongoing context that should persist across sessions but is not:
- a stable user preference (`USER.md`)
- a workspace operating rule (`AGENTS.md`)
- tool behavior knowledge (`TOOLS.md`)
- personality guidance (`SOUL.md`)

Keep entries concise and factual. Remove stale items.
