# Memory Graph

Root of the user's memory graph. All documents are organized as children of this node or nested under other nodes.

## Structure

Each document captures durable knowledge: preferences, decisions, people, projects, strategies, tool knowledge, and processes. Documents reference children via `[[nodeId]]` wiki-links.

## Usage

- Read this root and the graph tree before creating or updating documents.
- Always specify parent nodes when creating new documents.
- Merge into existing documents when topics overlap — avoid duplicates.
- Keep documents dense and specific. Cut filler.
